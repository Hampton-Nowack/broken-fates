In a terminal, use git clone https://github.com/computc/Broken-Fates.git to download this project to your computer (or git sync to get new additions others have made if you already have this project) and git checkout Development to start editting in the Development branch. Then use Unity to edit and update it and then use git add -A (to add all changes), git commit -m "comment about what you added" and git push to add to the project

Most commits will be made in the Development Branch.
